          <h1 class="feature-header">Built to know what your plants need</h1>
          <p>Different plants have different needs. Some need watering weekly. Some need it monthly. Then in the winter, who even knows! Water My Plants 2 knows - and we help you figure it out. Create a list of the plants you own, update when you water them, and we'll send you reminders when they need it next. </p>
          <p>Plants also require differing amounts of sunlight. Have a great southern exposure that you want to throw a couple of Pothos in? Maybe a bookshelf in your living room that doesn't get direct sunlight? With Water My Plants 2's roomscanner technology, we'll build a virutal floor plan of your home, orient it properly with the sun, and suggest placement for all of your greren buddies.</p>

            <h3>Debbie Waterstheplant</h3>
            <p>You may be thinking, "Hey that's the Singapore airport!". And you'd be right. Debbie Waterstheplant is the resident botanist for Changi International, and she couldn't make it this lucious without the help of Water My Plants 2. "Each plant's position is optimized" she says, "and we've custom-built an interior irrigation system that WMP controls. Changi would be a barren wasteland like Laguardia if not for Water My Plants 2."</p>

            <h3>Jake Propersunlight</h3>
            <p>Jake's pottery studio in Detroit needed a little green. "I was lucky to buy a 45,000 square foot warehouse in the heart of downtown for $7,200 a couple of years ago," Jake said. "But it was a bit bleak inside. Several of my friends described it as 'Chernobyl-esque'. So I popped a couple of plants in the front windows and a grow operation in the back room. Water My Plants 2 keeps the leaves green and lets me focus on cranking out artisinal coffee mugs."</p>

            <h3>Angie Growsalot</h3>
            <p>Angie runs a high-end medical spa in the Swiss alps that's only accessible by helicopter. Her clientele - mostly oligarchs - requires all of her attention, and the spa's foliage was neglected. "WMP2 allows me to maintain a lush, healthy aura without any effort at all," she says. "My clients are soothed, and generally their immortatilty treatments are much more effective."</p>

          <h3>Maggie Alkaline-Soil</h3>
          <p>Maggie's bookstore was overrun with bobcats. It was a strange problem, but these are strange times. Her homeopathic healer suggested she install a rare species of fern that bobcats are known to hate. "The bobcats are gone entirely, and Water My Plants 2 does all the hard work," Maggie says. "Knowing when to water the ferns, and how to rotate them based on the seasonal position of the sun, has really made it a breeze." Book sales are down a bit, but so are bobcat-related complaints. </p>
